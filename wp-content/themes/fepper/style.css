Theme Name: Fepper
Theme URI: https://fepper.io/?project=wordpress
Description: The Fepper theme for WordPress includes templates generated by the Fepper frontend prototyper as well as styles, scripts, and theme functions which build out the WordPress theme to match the look and feel of the Fepper frontend. This responsive theme is ideal for incorporating rapid prototyping via Pattern Lab into your WordPress development flow. There is probably no other theme which provides any reasonably working interface between these two very different platforms.
